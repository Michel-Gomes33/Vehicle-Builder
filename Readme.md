## Description

This project is a Typescript command-line application that allows the user to create, select, and store vehicles. The user is prompted with questions such as vehicle type, make, model, year, and so on. Additionally, the app allows to navigate if the truck needs to tow another vehicle, and if the motorbike is performing a wheelie.
